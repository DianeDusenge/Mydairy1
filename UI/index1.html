            <h3>Tips to write your dairy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you are somebody who keeps a written diary about your recent life and the changes that have occurred, then you may be acutely aware of just how difficult it can be at times to actually make a quality diary post. It can take a considerable
                amount of time, and you don't want to write a load of nonsense that you aren't even sure fits the purposes of a diary! A diary is purely your thoughts and feelings on any subject that takes your fancy. Remember, though, that in time you
                will be looking back on these writings and you may want to share them with others, so making sure they make sense and can actually be read by others is very important! Taking that little bit of extra time to really record your thoughts
                and to dissect your thoughts properly can make a significant difference to the outcome of your writing. If you are struggling to come up with quality, unique insights that actually relate to how you feel and see the world, then try out
                these tips below:
                <b>1.Be honest 2. Be Detailed 3. Spell Check 4. Dates 5. Giving your entry a title 6. Write short entries 7. Don't worry if you can't add to it every day</b></p>
